## Introduction

Recall the research question from the tutorial activity.

> Did mortgage providers approve an application differently based on the 
applicant's sex in Boston in 1990?

To answer the question, you are asked to conduct a multiverse analysis testing
the following set of hypotheses at 5% significance level, or 95% confidence 
level.

> - $H_0$: No, they were as likely to approve female applicants as male 
applicants.
> - $H_1$: Yes, they were either more likely or less likely to approve female
applicants than male applicants.

## Data

We will use the same dataset `hdma`.

```{r readdata}
# the dataset is stored in the file named hdma.csv
hdma <- read.csv("hdma.csv")
hdma 
```

Each row of the dataset represents a mortgage application with the following
information in the columns:

+  `is_approved` is 1 if the application was approved and 0 otherwise.
+  `is_female` is 1 if the applicant was a female and 0 otherwise.
+  `is_black` is 1 if the applicant was a black or Hispanic and 0 if the 
applicant was non-Hispanic white. The dataset does not contain other races.
+  `is_married` is 1 if the applicant was married and 0 otherwise.
+  `is_housing_expense_ratio_high` is 1 if the bank's calculation of housing
expense over income exceeds 30% and 0 otherwise.
+  `is_self_employed` is 1 if the applicant was self-employed and 0 otherwise.
+  `is_bad_credit` is 1 if the applicant had one or more public records such as
bankruptcy, charge offs, and collection actions and 0 otherwise.
+  `payment_income_ratio` is the bank's calculation of total debt payment over
income in percentages.
+  `loan_to_value_ratio` is the value of the loan amount over the appraisal
value of the property in percentages.

## Defining the multiverse

Assume that any combination of the extra variables, or covariates, included in 
the dataset makes a defensible model for answering the research question. In
the code chunk below, define the multiverse that consists of ALL defensible 
models for answering the research question using the dataset `hdma`. All models
must:

1. be a linear regression model,
2. set `is_approved` as the response variable, and
3. set `is_female` as an explanatory variable.

```{r definemv}
# define the multiverse

```

## Fitting the multiverse

In the code chunk below, fit and store the following quantities from each model
in the multiverse:

1. the coefficient estimate of `is_female`, and
2. the upper and lower bound of the estimates' 95% confidence intervals.

```{r fitmv}
# fit the multiverse

```

## Exploring the multiverse

In the code chunk below, visualize the estimated coefficients and the associated
95% confidence intervals. Organize the plot such that:

1. the models, or the universes, are grouped by whether they include both 
`is_black` and `is_married`, and
2. the models, or the universes, are ordered by the magnitude of the estimated
coefficient within each group.
